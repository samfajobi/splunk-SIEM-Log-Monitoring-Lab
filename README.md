# Network Detection and Response (NDR) System using Suricata and Zeek

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **Network Detection and Response (NDR)** lab using **Suricata** and **Zeek**, two powerful open-source network security monitoring tools.

The goal of this project is to simulate **real-world SOC network monitoring**, where traffic is continuously inspected, suspicious activity is detected, enriched, and investigated, and actionable security insights are produced.

This lab mirrors how enterprise SOCs detect threats such as:

* Network intrusions
* Malware command-and-control (C2)
* Port scanning and reconnaissance
* Data exfiltration
* Suspicious DNS and HTTP activity

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Understand how **network traffic flows** through detection engines
* Learn the **difference between signature-based and behavioral detection**
* Gain hands-on experience with **Suricata (IDS)** and **Zeek (NSM)**
* Correlate alerts with rich network metadata
* Build SOC-ready investigation and analysis skills

## 🔍 Tool Breakdown

### 🛡️ Suricata – Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

Suricata is responsible for **detecting malicious or suspicious activity** using:

* Signature-based detection (rules)
* Protocol analysis
* Threat intelligence feeds

Suricata answers the question:

> **“Is this network traffic malicious?”**

**Key Outputs:**

* Alerts (`eve.json`)
* Flow records
* DNS and HTTP events

---

### 🧠 Zeek – Network Security Monitoring (NSM)

Zeek focuses on **deep visibility and context**, not alerts.

It extracts and logs:

* Connection metadata (`conn.log`)
* DNS queries (`dns.log`)
* HTTP requests (`http.log`)
* TLS/SSL details (`ssl.log`)
* File transfers

Zeek answers the question:

> **“What exactly happened on the network?”**
